// values, datatypes, variables
// values are basically a piece of data, its the fundamental unit of information in programming

// DATA-TYPES
// in javascript, every value has data types (you can have at least 6 different data types), Data types includes:
// Numbers : so called floating point numbers ex:whole numbers with decimals (5.0, 6.0) rounding
// string: sequence of characters A,B,C which are denoted with either single or double quote
// Boolean: these are logical data types which can only be true or false
// undefined: This is the value taken by a viariable that is empty or hasn't been assigned a value and will still be assigned a value in the future
// - (variables are used to store values which you want to re-use)
// - (variables can be declared using the let and const)
// Null: when nothing is assigned to a variable which has a specific use case
// Big integer (big int): used to get an accurate reading for larger numbers

let variable1 = "3";
console.log(variable1);

let my;
console.log(my);

let my1 = null;
console.log(my1);
